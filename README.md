This repository contains the source code and relevant materials for my Bachelor's thesis at the University of Paderborn. The project investigates "Predictive Process Monitoring for Knowledge-Intensive Processes using Text-aware and Cluster-based PPM."
# Overview

The Bachelor's thesis explores the application of Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) to knowledge-intensive business processes. In this context, text-based and cluster-based approaches are combined to develop predictive models and make predictions for the course of processes in knowledge domains. This is particularly focused on the stage-gate process for the development of new inventions in production.
